Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

```
function digital_root(n) {
  let result = +String(n).split('').reduce((res, x) => +res + +x);
